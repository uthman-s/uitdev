Instructions for creating repository and uploading files:

1) Create a new repo on GitHub
   - Name: `uitdev-portfolio`
   - Description: "Portfolio for UIT / Uthman Sayedi"
   - Public (or private if you prefer)

2) Locally (example)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: simple UIT portfolio"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/UTHMAN_USERNAME/uitdev-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```
Replace `UTHMAN_USERNAME` with your GitHub username (e.g., `uthman-s`).

3) Hosting on one.com
   - Login to your one.com control panel.
   - If your domain (uitdev.com) is hosted at one.com, add it to your web hotel and upload files to the `public_html` folder via File Manager or FTP.
   - If your domain is elsewhere, point the domain's nameservers or A-record to one.com according to their instructions (use the nameservers one.com provides or follow the control panel's DNS instructions).
   - Enable SSL through the one.com control panel (typically free via their Let's Encrypt integration).

FTP (if you use FTP):
- Server: ftp.one.com (or the server info one.com provides)
- Username: your one.com username
- Password: your password from one.com

Note: one.com has detailed guides in their help center. If you prefer to use GitHub Pages instead, I can also adapt the site for that.

4) CNAME (optional)
If you want to use GitHub Pages (not necessary for one.com), add the `CNAME` file with `uitdev.com`.
